# To Community

[To Community](https://to.community) is a set of strategies for bonding companies to communities. It's also an open research program on how to transition society to new forms of community ownership and governance. Here’s what we’re working on:
1. **Open Founder Interviews**: research on founder openness to alternative financing, leading toward a public article. <!-- [Summary + how to contribute!]() -->

2. **Product Discovery as Cooperative Communication**: mathematical modeling research. See the [To Community 1-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwcdIuacdUHd_bQTCdA8V3_3w6-0Aj_AIIo8oSOnNPI).

3. **Software for E2C**: an open-source software framework to help companies exit to community To Community (1-pager). Also, see our YC pitch video.Software for E2C: an open-source software framework to help companies exit to community.

## Open Founder Interviews
We are looking collaborators on the founder interview project. We hope to develop an understanding of the degrees of freedom available (to investors and to founders) in encouraging / incentivizing collective financing for early-stage tech startups. For example, under what conditions can founders negotiate capped returns with investors. Under what conditions can investors tell founders to implement some form of democratic decision-making in their startup?

Our target deliverables are (in order): 
- a decision tree for collective financing and [an updated causal system map of startup and investor incentives](https://kumu.io/thelastjosh/to-community#default-map)
- an open data set of interviews with founders and investors (including other ethnographic data)
- through interviews, a decision on whether to focus on founders or investors for further research and development
- a public business-model canvas for "To Community", a set of strategies for bonding companies to communities
- a proposal for collective financing (legal, technical, etc.) synthesizing progressive decentralization, E2C, and other options
- an HBR-style general audience article summarizing these results
