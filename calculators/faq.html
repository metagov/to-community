                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">What is this tool?</h2>
                <p>Exit to Community requires fully transitioning ownership and governance rights of a company to the
                    community of people who most rely on the products, services and technologies produced by the
                    organization. Like any business exit, this is not an easy transition and often requires some
                    resources to be invested to for example: negotiate terms of the exit with founders and investors,
                    restructure the operations of the organization to allow for community ownership and governance, hire
                    lawyers to draw up new contracts and bylaws, etc. The E2C Calculator is a tool to help you assess
                    your E2C readiness and decide whether your organization and community are in a good position to make
                    the additional investment required to execute an E2C in future.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Who this tool is for?</h2>
                <p>This tool is for organizations who are either exploring the option of E2C and want to find out if it
                    would be suitable for them, as well as for communities who are already fully committed to this path
                    forward and curious to assess if they’re ready to take the next big step. Ideally, after using this
                    tool you will have a clearer understanding of how ready your organization is for community ownership
                    and which areas you should be working on more.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">How to use this tool?</h2>
                <p>After answering a set of questions relating to the current state and operations of your business and
                    community, the tool will indicate a readiness score for you. The score helps you anchor yourself on
                    the path to E2C. You will also receive dedicated scores for each section in which you answered
                    questions, helping you to assess which areas to potentially improve on in order to feel confident
                    about your E2C.</p>
                <p>In principle, any member of such an organization or community can fill out the assessment from their
                    perspective. The tool is most effective when stakeholders who are crucial throughout the E2C process
                    (current business owners, community leaders) align in their assessment of the organization and
                    community in question. Having a common understanding of how things are and where they should go is
                    an important first step on the path to E2C.</p>
                <p>We envision the tool to be used both by individuals, curious to explore the opportunities and risks
                    of E2C in their given context, as well as for stakeholder groups coming together to make a decision.
                    Here, the calculator should be used as a tool that helps to anchor the group’s conversation, focus
                    attention where it matters and ultimately help all stakeholders come to a collective decision that
                    everyone feels comfortable with.</p>

                <p>Because user/ community ownership needs to be more of a thing! Yet, it’s a really difficult path for
                    organizations to go. All business exits are difficult and require significant negotiation, time and
                    resources. Especially, venturing down a lesser known exit strategy, such as E2C, can bring a lot of
                    risk and uncertainty. Consequently, feeling confident in being ready to seriously explore and
                    implement this type of exit is an important first step in the transition process itself. The E2C
                    Calculators helps communities build an understanding and thus confidence in their own readiness and
                    potential areas to address in order to become even more ready.</p>
